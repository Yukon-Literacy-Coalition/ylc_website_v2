YLC staff come equipped with fun and relevant literacy and essential skills activities for people of all ages to enjoy. It's free and is a fun way to encourage a life-long love of learning. In the past, we’ve attended Kluane First Nation Harvest Camp, The Moosehide Gathering, Kluane Muskrat Camp, Has Ḵusteeyí Celebration and Ta'an Fish Camp.","title":"Culture Camps","thumbnail":"/uploads/6d724445-9fba-4a7e-bd3a-2c1c9f728a61_1_105_c.jpeg","slug":"culture-camps"},{"body":"The ever-popular book bike is a mobile library that we pedal all over town and throughout the territory. The goal is simple: to find new homes for books donated by Yukoners themselves. No due dates! No late fees! We love to watch books get into the hands of readers of all ages.","title":"Book Bike","slug":"book-bike"},{"body":"The YLC partners with the Kwanlin Dün First Nation in their Kenädän Ku (House of Learning) afterschool tutoring program. This program encourages the development of essential skills and positive reading behaviours without mirroring a school environment. It's designed for kids who benefit from additional support in fluid reading practice, vocabulary study, reading comprehension, and learning confidence. Currently, YLC staff engage students in Kids in the Kitchen cooking lessons, where they learn independent cooking skills, kitchen safety, and the power of cooperation.","title":"School-Aged Programs","slug":"school-aged-programs"}]},"path":"family/outreach"}
