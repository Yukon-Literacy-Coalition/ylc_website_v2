We offer mini programs most mornings and drop-in play time during the afternoon. The FLC offers free, daily, drop-in programs that help parents build both their parenting and life skills, while providing young children with early childhood education opportunities. Our qualified staff specialize in early childhood education and promote early learning and literacy skills. We help connect families to the community resources they need and support families to become lifelong learners. \n\nThe FLC is located on the second floor of the Canada Games Centre and is open from September through May.
