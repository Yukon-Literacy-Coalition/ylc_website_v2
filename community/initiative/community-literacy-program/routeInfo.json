Facilitators are trained how to design and create their specific programs and learn how to embed literacy and essential skills. This past year, a facilitator from Carcross offered a traditional medicine and planting program, a facilitator from Teslin offered a community carpentry program that made benches for their community, and facilitators from Mayo ran a food security program which provided the local daycare with a garden bed and planting supplies.","title":"Community Literacy Program","subTitle":"Embedding Literacy","link":"","linkText":"","images":[],"slug":"community-literacy-program"}},"path":"community/initiative/community-literacy-program"}
