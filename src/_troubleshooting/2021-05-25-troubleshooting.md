        mainBody: "**Root maggots** can infect radishes, onions, cauliflower, turnips
          and related crops. The simplest solution is to keep susceptible crops
          covered with a floating row cover for May and early June when the
          flies are out laying their eggs. Excluding them should do the trick.
          Onions are particularly prone to root maggots and should remain
          covered from the time they sprout until they are harvested. Any roots
          with a maggot infestation should be put in the garbage, not in the
          compost where the larvae can live through the winter and return to
          attack plants next year."

      body: "*Tip: Plant onions the first week of June to avoid the 1st crop of onion
        flies which is the most devastating. Do not plant onions in same place
        for 2 years. Try using cayenne, dill on the ground and moth balls in
        jars to fend of flies right from the start. Use a combination of
        deterrents.*"
