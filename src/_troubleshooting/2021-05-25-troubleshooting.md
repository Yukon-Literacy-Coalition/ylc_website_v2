      body: Being organized, clean and keeping a greenhouse and garden maintained will
        keep the plants mostly pest and disease free but you should lookout for
        common gardening challenges such as bugs, rodents, frosts, heat waves,
        and fungus.

        mainBody: "**Root maggots** can infect radishes, onions, cauliflower, turnips
          and related crops. The simplest solution is to keep susceptible crops
          covered with a floating row cover for May and early June when the
          flies are out laying their eggs. Excluding them should do the trick.
          Onions are particularly prone to root maggots and should remain
          covered from the time they sprout until they are harvested. Any roots
          with a maggot infestation should be put in the garbage, not in the
          compost where the larvae can live through the winter and return to
          attack plants next year."

        belowMedia: "*Tip: Plant onions the first week of June to avoid the 1st crop of
          onion flies which is the most devastating. Do not plant onions in same
          place for 2 years. Try using cayenne, dill on the ground and moth
          balls in jars to fend of flies right from the start. Use a combination
          of deterrents.*"

        mainBody: "**Aphids** are small sap-sucking insects which are among the most
          destructive pests in the garden. The removal of sap creates a lack of
          vigor in the plant, and aphid saliva is toxic to plants. Aphids
          frequently transmit disease-causing organisms like plant viruses,
          bacteria and fungi to their hosts. Symptoms of aphid damage can be as
          varied as decreased growth rates, mottled leaves, yellowing, stunted
          growth, curled leaves, browning, wilting, low yields and death. For
          limited infestations, using an insecticidal soap or simply spraying
          the plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days is
          generally sufficient to control the problem. Heavily infested plants
          should be removed and placed in the garbage."

          *Tip: Plant Marigolds in a pot and place around your plants. The
          aphids will be attracted to them and you can quickly and easily remove
          the pot and put in the garbage to avoid mass infestation.*


          *Tip: Aphids come into the greenhouse in a number of different ways: with the wind, on clothing, and by infected plants. Itâ€™s important to check weekly for signs of aphids and remove infected plants from the greenhouse.*
