      body: Being organized, clean and keeping a greenhouse and garden maintained will
        keep the plants mostly pest and disease free but you should lookout for
        common gardening challenges such as bugs, rodents, frosts, heat waves,
        and fungus.

          and related crops. The simplest solution is to keep susceptible crops
          covered with a floating row cover for May and early June when the
          flies are out laying their eggs. Excluding them should do the trick.
          Onions are particularly prone to root maggots and should remain
          covered from the time they sprout until they are harvested. Any roots
          with a maggot infestation should be put in the garbage, not in the
          compost where the larvae can live through the winter and return to
          attack plants next year."

          onion flies which is the most devastating. Do not plant onions in same
          place for 2 years. Try using cayenne, dill on the ground and moth
          balls in jars to fend of flies right from the start. Use a combination
          of deterrents.*"

        mainBody: "**Aphids** are small sap-sucking insects which are among the most
          destructive pests in the garden. The removal of sap creates a lack of
          vigor in the plant, and aphid saliva is toxic to plants. Aphids
          frequently transmit disease-causing organisms like plant viruses,
          bacteria and fungi to their hosts. Symptoms of aphid damage can be as
          varied as decreased growth rates, mottled leaves, yellowing, stunted
          growth, curled leaves, browning, wilting, low yields and death. For
          limited infestations, using an insecticidal soap or simply spraying
          the plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days is
          generally sufficient to control the problem. Heavily infested plants
          should be removed and placed in the garbage."
        belowMedia: "*Tip: Plant Marigolds in a pot and place around your plants. The
          aphids will be attracted to them and you can quickly and easily remove
          the pot and put in the garbage to avoid mass infestation.*"

      sideBySideBody:
        mainBody: >-
          Gophers can be an ongoing challenge throughout the summer. They can be
          trapped live and relocated to a different site away from your
          greenhouse and/or garden. It is important that the live traps are
          checked every few hours so that the animals are not harmed or unduly
          stressed for longer periods. Remember to pick them up at the end of
          the day.


          There may be the odd mouse or vole around. Try to prohibit them with fine mesh chicken wire around the garden beds, and the bottom of the greenhouses.

        mainBody: The frost-free season is very short in the Yukon, usually from about
          mid-May or early June until mid-August or early September. If the
          morning air starts to feel cool and the forecast says it is going to
          get below 0 degrees overnight, itâ€™s a good time to cover the outdoor
          garden beds. Start covering the outdoor garden beds in mid-August.

          beds. Cover them over at the end of the day and open them up
          mid-morning the next day once it warmed up. This will protect the
          outdoor plants from frost before harvesting.*"

      sideBySideBody:
        mainBody: Heat waves can dry surface soil quickly, which dehydrates shallow
          roots and water is also lost through the leaves in hot weather. The
          plants need thorough watering during a heatwave, which should be done
          early in the morning. In extreme hot weather a greenhouse and/ or
          garden may need a second watering later in the day.

          **Powdery mildew** is a fungal disease that shows up as white, powdery
          spots on the leaves and stems of plants. It thrives in cool, humid
          conditions and cloudy weather can help it increase. Cucumbers, melons,
          strawberries and all types of squash are most affected by it. Powdery
          mildew can be controlled by spacing plants to allow for better air
          circulation, which will keep the humidity down. Aphids can carry
          powdery mildew and transmit it to surrounding garden plots, so
          monitoring and pest control are\

          important.

        mainBody: "**Damping off disease** is a white mold that forms in the top of the
          soil. When starting bedding plants, little seeds are prone to this
          fungus. Damping off disease flourishes in cold, wet damp weather with
          little sunshine. It quickly spreads across the soil and wilts the
          seedling. Take its habitat away, and the disease cannot survive. The
          more you make conditions ideal for your plants, the more likely you
          will avoid damping off disease. Avoid starting the seeds in a basement
          and leaving them there for a couple of days. While the trays are
          conveniently out of the way, this is a perfect breeding ground for
          damping off disease."
        belowMedia: "*Tip:  If damping off disease does take hold in your seed trays,
          act immediately. Remove diseased sections to minimize the spread. If
          it has affected a significant number of plants, replant in new soil
          and clean containers. Do not reuse the soil.*"
