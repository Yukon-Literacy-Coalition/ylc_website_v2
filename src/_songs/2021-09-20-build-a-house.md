          ### **Build a House**


          ##### *You will need:*


          * Wood, plastic or sturdy cardboard for the felt board

          * Piece of felt that is larger than the board

          * Masking tape

          * Variety of felt colours


          ##### *Instructions:*


          1. Lay the board on top of the large piece of felt

          2. Fold the edges of the felt over the board, one at a time, and tape securely to the board using wide masking tape

          3. Pull gently on the fabric as you tape it down to maintain a smooth surface on the felt board side

          4. The felt board works best if it is positioned at an angle to support the felt cut-outs

          5. Cut out different shapes that can be used to build a house
