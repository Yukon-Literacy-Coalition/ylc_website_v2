We’re excited to announce that the Family Literacy Centre re-opens Tuesday, October 13th at 10:00 a.m. Located upstairs at the Canada Games Centre in Whitehorse, the FLC offers, free, drop-in programs for children and families to learn and play together. Join us for crafts, singing, activities, story time, sensory play and more! No registration or wristbands required.

In order to make programming safe for our families during the pandemic, we’ve made a few changes to our space that make practicing the “Safe Six” simple. For example, free play will consist of activity stations that make it easier to social distance.

If you have any questions, or would like to know more about what we’re doing to keep COVID-safe, give us a call at 867 668 8698, or 867 668 6535.
