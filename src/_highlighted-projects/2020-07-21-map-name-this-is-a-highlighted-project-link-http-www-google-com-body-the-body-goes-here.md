In the summer of 2020, the Yukon Literacy Coalition launched a youth entrepreneurship initiative that supports and offers opportunities and guidance to Yukon youth (12-18 years old) who want to work for themselves and with others. The Yukon Literacy Coalition assists with start-up costs, marketing, budgeting and anything else to help the youth succeed with their project.
