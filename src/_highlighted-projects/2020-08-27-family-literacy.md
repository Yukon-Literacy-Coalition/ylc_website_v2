At the FLC, we haven’t let the pandemic get in the way of families learning and playing together. We’ve set-up a broad selection of ready-to-go crafts and activities, just for you! Pick-up a tray, have a seat, and have fun. Colour-by-number; paint wood; explore magnetism make Oobleck, and much more. There’s something for everyone!
