Have you checked-out our single-use crafts and activities?                       

At the FLC, we haven’t let the pandemic get in the way of families learning and playing together. Outside of our usual toys, puzzles, and games, we’ve set-up a table with a broad selection of ready-to-go crafts and activities, just for you! Pick-up a tray, have a seat, and wash + dry a load of play laundry. Colour by number, paint wood with acrylic markers, or glue and paste a “penguin paradise.” Explore magnetism, make Oobleck, and much, much more. There’s something for everyone!

And don’t forget, when it’s time to go, pick-up one of our takeaway crafts to bring home and enjoy later. See you soon!
