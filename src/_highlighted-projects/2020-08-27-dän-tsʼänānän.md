The Yukon Literacy Coalition in partnership with CAFN and Yukon College are working together to provide training and employment to CAFN citizens through innovative and creative programming.  Among other things the Yukon Literacy Coalition assisted in the development of a greenhouse/gardening program which is thriving in year three.  As well as providing lots of vegetables for the community many citizens have benefited from this work/training opportunity.
