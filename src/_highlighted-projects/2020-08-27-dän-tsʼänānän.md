Darcy, the community facilitator in Dawson has started a sewing program this winter. The hope of being able to sew baby bonnets, childrenâ€™s mitts and toques and traditional anoraks. We look forward to hopefully being able to offer the sewing program to members of the public in Dawson as soon as it is safe to do so.
