      body: Gardening is all about learning. If you’re new – find a mentor and ask
        questions, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes. Every year is
        different, and what worked well one year, might not the next. Plants can
        be temperamental and finicky. Make sure you’re taking time to have fun
        and enjoy the delicious successes! Use the resources below to help you
        get started.
