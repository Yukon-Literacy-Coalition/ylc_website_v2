      body: Once you have planted seeds and starters in the gardens, there are several
        things that need to be done on a regular basis to keep your garden
        growing and healthy. Greenhouses and gardens need to be watered
        regularly. You never want the greenhouses or garden beds to dry out, or
        to be too wet. Ongoing care and maintenance of the greenhouses and
        gardens takes dedication, if the forecast is going to be hot over the
        weekend, make sure there is someone available to come and water the
        plants. Plants and gardens need care everyday, 7 days a week.

        mainBody: Plants will need to be watered regularly, especially if the
          envirnoment is dry or it is windy. Gardens dry out quickly in the
          wind. Deep watering is more effective than just sprinkling the water
          on the surface. Plant roots need water to grow; Surface watering
          encourages plant roots to stay on the surface where they may dry out.
          Hanging baskets may need 2-3 watering’s per day in hot windy weather.

      subTitle: "Feeding "
      body: As well as water, plants absorb nutrients and minerals through their
        roots. These include nitrogen (N), which aids leafy growth, phosphorus
        (P), which encourages root development and potassium (K), which
        encourages flower and fruit development. These are considered the main
        nutrients required to keep plants healthy.

        mainBody: Fertilizing can happen in different ways. One way to fertilize the
          plants is using a water soluble 20-20-20 fertilizer every 2-3 weeks.
          The exact directions will be on the bag, but typically use 1-2
          tablespoons per watering can (7L).

        mainBody: You can side dress your plants with a nitrogen fertilizer alongside
          the row of growing plants. Just keep in mind that it is possible to
          apply too much nitrogen, so use sparingly. Don’t put the fertilizer
          directly on the plant, just to the side of it.

      body: Another way to fertilize is the ‘side dressing’ method. This can be done
        during the season when you notice your plants turning yellow. That is a
        sign that important nutrients have been leached or washed out of the
        plant roots. Plants yellowing is a sign that they are missing Nitrogen.

        #### **Weeding**


        Weeding is one of those jobs that just needs to be done. Weeds take up space, water and nutrients in the garden. Some, like chickweed, can grow so quickly that they choke out your crops, so it’s best to address the problem early on. The best time to weed is right after a rain or after you’ve watered, when the ground is soft. All weeds should be pulled out by the roots and as early as possible to avoid them going to seed and overtaking the beds. This is important.


        Some weeds such as brome grass can grow back from small sections of root left in the soil. It’s important to get the weeds before they go to seed otherwise you may end up with weeds not just in one bed but in all the beds. The weeds should not be put in the compost pile. 


        Sometimes it can be hard to tell if a seedling is a weed or something you have planted. If you’re not sure if a plant is a weed, wait until you can see if it’s part of a line of plants. The plants in a line are probably vegetables since weeds seldom grow in a straight line. Removing tall grass and weeds from the inside and around the greenhouses and garden beds reduces the chance of weeds spreading and also reduces pests (like gophers) from coming into the greenhouse for a snack!
