      body: Once you have planted seeds and starters in the gardens, there are several
        things that need to be done on a regular basis to keep your garden
        growing and healthy. Greenhouses and gardens need to be watered
        regularly. You never want the greenhouses or garden beds to dry out, or
        to be too wet. Ongoing care and maintenance of the greenhouses and
        gardens takes dedication, if the forecast is going to be hot over the
        weekend, make sure there is someone available to come and water the
        plants. Plants and gardens need care everyday, 7 days a week.

        mainBody: Plants will need to be watered regularly, especially if the
          envirnoment is dry or it is windy. Gardens dry out quickly in the
          wind. Deep watering is more effective than just sprinkling the water
          on the surface. Plant roots need water to grow; Surface watering
          encourages plant roots to stay on the surface where they may dry out.
          Hanging baskets may need 2-3 wateringâ€™s per day in hot windy weather.
