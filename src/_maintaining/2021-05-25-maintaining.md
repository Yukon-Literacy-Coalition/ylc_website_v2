      body: Once you have planted seeds and starters in the gardens, there are several
        things that need to be done on a regular basis to keep your garden
        growing and healthy. Greenhouses and gardens need to be watered
        regularly. You never want the greenhouses or garden beds to dry out, or
        to be too wet. Ongoing care and maintenance of the greenhouses and
        gardens takes dedication, if the forecast is going to be hot over the
        weekend, make sure there is someone available to come and water the
        plants. Plants and gardens need care everyday, 7 days a week.

        mainBody: Plants will need to be watered regularly, especially if the
          envirnoment is dry or it is windy. Gardens dry out quickly in the
          wind. Deep watering is more effective than just sprinkling the water
          on the surface. Plant roots need water to grow; Surface watering
          encourages plant roots to stay on the surface where they may dry out.
          Hanging baskets may need 2-3 watering’s per day in hot windy weather.

      body: As well as water, plants absorb nutrients and minerals through their
        roots. These include nitrogen (N), which aids leafy growth, phosphorus
        (P), which encourages root development and potassium (K), which
        encourages flower and fruit development. These are considered the main
        nutrients required to keep plants healthy.

        mainBody: Fertilizing can happen in different ways. One way to fertilize the
          plants is using a water soluble 20-20-20 fertilizer every 2-3 weeks.
          The exact directions will be on the bag, but typically use 1-2
          tablespoons per watering can (7L).

          Another way to fertilize is the ‘side dressing’ method. This can be
          done during the season when you notice your plants turning yellow.
          That is a sign that important nutrients have been leached or washed
          out of the plant roots. Plants yellowing is a sign that they are
          missing Nitrogen.


          You can side dress your plants with a nitrogen fertilizer alongside the row of growing plants. Just keep in mind that it is possible to apply too much nitrogen, so use sparingly. Don’t put the fertilizer directly on the plant, just to the side of it.
