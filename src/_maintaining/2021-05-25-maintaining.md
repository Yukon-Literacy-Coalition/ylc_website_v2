      body: Once you have planted seeds and starters in the gardens, there are several
        things that need to be done on a regular basis to keep your garden
        growing and healthy. Greenhouses and gardens need to be watered
        regularly. You never want the greenhouses or garden beds to dry out, or
        to be too wet. Ongoing care and maintenance of the greenhouses and
        gardens takes dedication, if the forecast is going to be hot over the
        weekend, make sure there is someone available to come and water the
        plants. Plants and gardens need care everyday, 7 days a week.
