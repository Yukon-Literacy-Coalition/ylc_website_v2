          ### 10 Rowdy Ravens


          ##### *Written by Susan Ewing*


          ##### *Illustrations by Evon Zerbetz*


          Ten ravens set out on a lark. As the pages turn, they steal pretty pearls, picnic in a pickup truck, and pull a predatorâ€™s tail. Scenarios are fanciful but rooted in ravenhood: collecting shiny things, testing curious objects, getting into garbage, and showing off. The adventures take their numbers down to 1, and they reunite to play the game all over again.
