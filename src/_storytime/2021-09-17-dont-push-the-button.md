          ### **Don't Push The Button**


          ##### *written and illustrated by Bill Cotter*


          *Time: 5:37*


          Larry the monster is up to his usual shenanigans in this bestseller by Bill Cotter. A great read-aloud, interactive picture book that kids will go back to time and again.


          There's only one rule in Larry's book: don't push the button.


          (Seriously, don't even think about it!)
