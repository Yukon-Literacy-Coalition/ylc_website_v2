          ### **Don't Push The Button**


          ##### *written and illustrated by Bill Cotter*


          Larry the monster is up to his usual shenanigans in this bestseller by Bill Cotter. A great read-aloud, interactive picture book that kids will go back to time and again.


          There's only one rule in Larry's book: don't push the button.


          (Seriously, don't even think about it!)


          Even if it does look kind of nice, you must never push the button. Who knows what would happen?


          Okay, quick. No one is looking... push the button.


          Uh, oh.
