          #### The Wonky Donkey


          *Written by Craig Smith*


          *Illustrated by Katz Cowley*


          In this very funny, cumulative song, each page tells us something new about the donkey until we end up with a spunky, hanky-panky cranky stinky dinky lanky honky-tonky winky wonky donkey, which will have children in fits of laughter!
