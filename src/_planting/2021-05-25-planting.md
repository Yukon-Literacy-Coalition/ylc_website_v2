      subTitle: Reading Seed Packets
      body: >-
        A seed packet is more than just a pretty envelope. It’s a miniature
        biography that reveals all a gardener needs to know to successfully grow
        the seeds it contains. The information differs from company to company,
        but most likely it will contain:


        * A picture of the plant

        * The name of the plant 

        * A plant description 

        * The price and weight of the package 

        * The packed for/sell by date 

        * The planting depth for the seeds 

        * The conditions the plant needs (ex. sun/shade) 

        * The average height of the plant 

        * The days to germination 

        * The days to maturity 

        * If the plant is able to be direct planted (direct sow) 

        * If the plant needs to be started indoors and transplanted

          ***Thoughts to consider at the beginning of the season:*** 


          *Do you buy starters and also plant a few seeds of your own to have a continuous crop?* 


          *Consider using the seed swap at the Yukon Government Department of Energy, Mines and Resources library seed bank, and/or learn about seed saving to save seeds to use in future years.*
