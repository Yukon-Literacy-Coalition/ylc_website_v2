        The Yukon Literacy Coalition, NWT Literacy Council and Ilitaqsiniq
        (formerly known as Nunavut Literacy Council) are working together on a
        new four-year project titled ‘Three for Change’. This project is focused
        on developing and delivering Skills for Success training opportunities,
        as well as developing social enterprises across the North and within
        each individual territory. Although different in many ways, the
        territories share similar opportunities and challenges as we learn from
        and support one another.


        The Three for Change project will focus on creating hands-on learning opportunities while embedding five of the Skills for Success: Collaboration, Problem solving, Innovation and Creativity, Communication and Adaptability. These unique hands-on workshops throughout each territory will be taught in a Northern/Indigenous context.


        We will create a northern approach to developing a tri-territorial social enterprise through the collaboration of the three organizations. This will be used as a model for developing social enterprises across the North and within each individual territory to provide opportunities for community capacity building and training.
