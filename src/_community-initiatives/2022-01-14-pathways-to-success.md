        The Yukon Literacy Coalition (YLC) in partnership with Northern Vision
        Development Corporation (NVD) will design and implement the project to
        increase and enhance engagement, employment and skill development for
        employees in the hospitality industry in Whitehorse, Dawson City and
        Mayo. 


        This project will increase opportunity in the hospitality and customer service industry through pre-employment training programs and on-the-job mentorship by incorporating experiential, holistic, and engaging community-based approaches to learning.
