      subTitle: Men's Northern Research Project
      body: >-
        This community-based research project was a collaboration between the
        literacy councils of NWT, Nunavut, Labrador and Yukon.


        We intended to open dialogue about northern indigenous men’s experiences with learning and work. We wanted to better understand the barriers that northern First Nations, Inuit and Métis men face and, most important, what will help them succeed.


        We hope the research will lead to more effective programming and policies to support northern Indigenous men in learning, work and well-being.
