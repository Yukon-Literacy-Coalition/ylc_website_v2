      subTitle: Northern Men's Research Project
      body: >-
        This community-based research project was a collaboration between the
        literacy councils of NWT, Nunavut, Labrador and Yukon.


        We intended to open dialogue about northern indigenous men’s experiences with learning and work. We wanted to better understand the barriers that northern First Nations, Inuit and Métis men face and, most important, what will help them succeed.


        We hope the research will lead to more effective programming and policies to support northern Indigenous men in learning, work and well-being.

      subTitle: NALES - Northern Alliance for Literacy and Essential Skills
      body: >-
        The Yukon Literacy Coalition partnered with the NWT Literacy Council and
        Ilitaqsiniq - the Nunavut Literacy Council on a collaborative agreement
        with the Northern Alliance on Literacy & Essential Skills (NALES) to
        complete a three-year project called “Strengthening Literacy and
        Essential Skills Development and Labour Market Outcomes across Northern
        Canada for Adults with Low Skills Levels."


        The goal of this project was to strengthen literacy and essential skills development and to improve market outcomes across the north. The team reached out to Aboriginal youth and adults, both men and women, who were out-of-school or unemployed with low levels of literacy and essential skills in the remote north. Throughout this project, Aboriginal youth and adults had the opportunity to develop more transferable skills, become more employable, increase their access to the labour market, and experience more success within the northern economy.

      subTitle: Pan Northern Gathering
      body: >-
        The Yukon Literacy Coalition, NWT Literacy Council, and Ilitaqsiniq-the
        Nunavut Literacy Council jointly organized the *Made in the North:
        Policy & Practices Exchange on Skills Development* forum, which was held
        in Yellowknife, NWT, from October 23 to 25, 2012. Adult educators,
        employers, policy makers, language experts, literacy practitioners,
        aboriginal and community leaders, and others working in the area of
        literacy and essential skills development in the three territories and
        Labrador attended the forum.


        The purpose of the gathering was to support made-in-the-north approaches to adult learning, including literacy and essential skills; the sharing of ideas and resources; and the creation of a northern action network. The event was funded by the Government of Canada’s Office of Literacy and Essential Skills; Government of the Northwest Territories’ Department of Education, Culture and Employment; Government of Nunavut’s Department of Education; and Yukon Territorial Government’s Labour Market Programs and Services, Advanced Education.

      subTitle: Workforce and Workplace Literacy and Essential Skills
      body: With the support of the Office of Literacy and Essential Skills (OLES),
        the Yukon Literacy Coalition (YLC) undertook a project that would assess
        Yukon community stakeholder interests related to workplace and workforce
        literacy and essential skills (LES). Through consultations, the YLC
        heard about models and principles that could move the expanding field of
        workforce and workplace (LES) forward in the territory. A literature
        review was also carried out, as well as a scan of past and present
        workforce and workplace LES initiatives in Yukon.

              following similar reports from Northwest Territories and Nunavut
              Literacy Councils.

      subTitle: Dän Tsʼänānän
      body: >-
        The Yukon Literacy Coalition, Champagne Aishihik First Nations (CAFN),
        and Yukon College worked together on a 40-month project called Dän
        Tsʼänānän, which was a federally funded program designed to increase
        capacities and employment for CAFN citizens. The vision of the program
        was to deliver innovative and culturally appropriate programming that
        focused on peoples' strengths and brought about positive change for
        at-risk citizens. The intention was to increase literacy and employment
        skills of CAFN youth and adults that were out of school, under-employed,
        or unemployed.


        One of our program initiatives was a Greenhouse Workplace Training program. The 21-week program started in April of 2019 in the Village of Haines Junction, Yukon. It was designed to combine wellness, non-formal learning (soft skills) and formal learning (hard skills), with the operation of two commercial greenhouses.

        I yéi jinéiyi, i jeyées yéi jinganéi (The Making Work, Work for You)
        program was a 12- week hands-on learning program that started in
        Carcross in July 2020. It was designed to help participants plan,
        develop and operate a small business. The program was also designed to
        foster an entrepreneurial spirit and encourage and support personal
        wellness through physical, mental, spiritual and emotional health.


        With a high concentration on hands-on learning, the participants of the program had experienced running multiple pop-up businesses at the Whitehorse Outdoor Fireweed Community Market in Shipyards Park. This was a great opportunity to practice the skills needed to run a small business from start to finish. The participants experimented with a traditional bannock recipe and created new flavours weekly to sell at the market. They sold the fresh bannock with hand-pickedfireweed flower jelly, and sweetened earl grey tea with fireweed simple syrup.
