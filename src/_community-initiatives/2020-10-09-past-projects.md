      subTitle: Northern Men's Research Project
      body: >-
        This community-based research project was a collaboration between the
        literacy councils of NWT, Nunavut, Labrador and Yukon.


        We intended to open dialogue about northern indigenous men’s experiences with learning and work. We wanted to better understand the barriers that northern First Nations, Inuit and Métis men face and, most important, what will help them succeed.


        We hope the research will lead to more effective programming and policies to support northern Indigenous men in learning, work and well-being.

      subTitle: NALES - Northern Alliance for Literacy and Essential Skills
      body: >-
        The Yukon Literacy Coalition partnered with the NWT Literacy Council and
        Ilitaqsiniq - the Nunavut Literacy Council on a collaborative agreement
        with the Northern Alliance on Literacy & Essential Skills (NALES) to
        complete a three-year project called “Strengthening Literacy and
        Essential Skills Development and Labour Market Outcomes across Northern
        Canada for Adults with Low Skills Levels."


        The goal of this project was to strengthen literacy and essential skills development and to improve market outcomes across the north. The team reached out to Aboriginal youth and adults, both men and women, who were out-of-school or unemployed with low levels of literacy and essential skills in the remote north. Throughout this project, Aboriginal youth and adults had the opportunity to develop more transferable skills, become more employable, increase their access to the labour market, and experience more success within the northern economy.
