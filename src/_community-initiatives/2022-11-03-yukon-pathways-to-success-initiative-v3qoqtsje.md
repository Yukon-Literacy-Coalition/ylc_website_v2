        Yukon Pathways to Success is a project designed to address the needs and
        challenges faced by the hospitality and tourism sector. Through this
        project, the Yukon Literacy Coalition is developing training programs to
        strengthen the workforce, support local businesses, and promote a
        positive working environment. Training will be co-developed with
        community partners to ensure we are meeting local needs of businesses
        and including local knowledge from and about Yukon First Nations.


        Yukon Pathways to Success will include pre-employment training to help people build and practice the skills needed to thrive in the hospitality and tourism sector. We will also be arranging training around diversity and inclusion to ensure that everyone feels and knows they are welcome in this sector.


        This project will also build the framework for a Northern Employer of Choice program. This program will be designed using feedback from employees, thereby ensuring that workersâ€™ experiences and opinions are valued and that operators are aware of what people are looking for in an employer.


        Yukon Pathways to Success is a three-year project with the capacity for broad reach across the Yukon. We are excited to be working on this initiative to bolster and celebrate Yukon hospitality.
