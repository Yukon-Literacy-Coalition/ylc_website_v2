      subTitle: Empowering Youth
      body: We identified the need for a Yukon specific, youth-focused financial
        literacy training that met the unique circumstances and needs of our
        Yukon Youth. We provide youth with relevant information that allows them
        to learn, understand and develop the skills required to become more
        confident and informed about the decisions they make regarding personal
        finances and their futures. This approach allows us to meet our youth
        where they are at and tailor learning and skill development to the
        unique circumstances of specific youth, their communities and their
        stage in life.
