      body: Our Community Literacy program works with community facilitators from
        Yukon communities to design and run unique literacy programs.
        Facilitators are trained how to design and create their specific
        programs and learn how to embed literacy and essential skills. This past
        year, a facilitator from Carcross offered a traditional medicine and
        planting program, a facilitator from Teslin offered a community
        carpentry program that made benches for their community, and
        facilitators from Mayo ran a food security program which provided the
        local daycare with a garden bed and planting supplies.
