        Our Community Literacy program works with community facilitators from
        Yukon communities to design and deliver unique literacy programs.
        Facilitators are trained how to design and create their specific
        programs and learn how to embed literacy and essential skills.

        mainBody: The Rooted in Medicine program was a youth program delivered in
          Carcross, YT. It taught youth how to prepare traditional medicines
          including teas, lozenges, powders, lotion bars, salves, etc. They made
          medicine bags to store the medicines in. It incorporated food security
          through growing medicinal plants, herbs and vegetables. Adults,
          teachers and elders were involved in the program through a train- the-
          trainer approach.

      sideBySideBody:
        mainBody: Community members in Watson Lake had the opportunity to socialize
          safely and learn basic straight-line quilting. Each participant had
          use of their own sewing machine and created their own jellyroll quilt.
          To keep the group size small, the community held two five-week
          sessions with 8 participants in the first session and 7 in the second.
          There is interest to continue with the sewing program, with skilled
          sewers supporting novice sewers in gaining skills.

        mainBody: As part of the Food Security program with Yukon College in Mayo, YT
          program participants actively engaged in learning about gardening and
          food security. The participants fostered food security in the
          community by working with the community daycare to provide a garden
          bed for the children to learn more about where their food comes from
          and experience food production. The garden bed was designed, built and
          installed by participants. Vegetables, flowers and strawberries were
          planted with daycare children. During the summer, a daycare instructor
          continued to teach the children about gardening.

        mainBody: This program provided much needed weekend programming for the
          community of Carmacks. An artist from Whitehorse delivered two weekend
          sessions for youth and adults, one painting cherry blossom trees and
          birds, and the other painting a birch tree forest. The artist led
          two-hour workshops, one in the morning for adults, one in the
          afternoon for youth.

        Repair "
      sideBySideBody:
        mainBody: Delivered in Haines Junction, this workshop series focused on seed
          starting, building cold frames and small engine repair. It happened
          over several weekends and welcomed several community members. Seed
          starting included tips and tricks about growing in the cold climate,
          when to plant, what to do throughout the season, and how to harvest.
          Participants learned some carpentry basics and built cold frames to
          help keep their plants live a little longer during our short growing
          season. The most popular workshop was small engine repair. This
          two-part workshop focused on maintenance of machines, diagnosis of
          problems and repairing small engines.

      subTitle: Benches
      body: Residents of Teslin built benches with the school kids (ages 5-13) to put
        around the community.  They built 4 benches in total and they had
        families dedicate the benches to loved ones. A community dinner and
        celebration of the program has been put on hold due to Covid-19. When it
        is safe to do so a celebration dinner will be planned, and the benches
        will be moved to their permanent locations complete with the dedication
        plaques. Two benches will be placed outside the Teslin Tlingit Council
        office and two outside the Village of Teslin office.
