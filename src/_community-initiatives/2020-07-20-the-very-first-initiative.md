        Our Community Literacy program works with community facilitators from
        Yukon communities to design and run unique literacy programs.
        Facilitators are trained how to design and create their specific
        programs and learn how to embed literacy and essential skills. 


        We have supported a facilitator in Carcross to offer a traditional medicine and planting program, a facilitator in Teslin to offer a community carpentry program that made benches for their community, and facilitators from Mayo ran a food security program which provided the local daycare with a garden bed and planting supplies.


        We are currently running a quilting/sewing program in Watson Lake, and a painting program in Carmacks for adults and youth. For more information contact Darby at darby.macwilliam@yukonliteracy.com
