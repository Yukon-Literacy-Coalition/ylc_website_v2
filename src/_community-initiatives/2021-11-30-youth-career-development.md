        We are developing a program in partnership with the NWT and Nunavut
        Literacy Councils that is focused towards building employable skills for
        youth aged 15-30. We aim to deliver an exciting and engaging activity
        where the participants will be working through various fields of
        interest and bolstering their resumes through completion of various
        certificates.


        Through our program participants will recognize and further develop their skills and learn other ways to integrate them into an employment setting. Our program will create a network of organizations and community contributors to help with the recruitment process and perhaps be specialists for certain activities of the program if interested.


        The Empowering Northern Youth through Career Development (ENYCD) program is a tri-territorial effort between the Yukon Literacy Coalition, the NWT Literacy Council, and Ilitaqsiniq Nunavut Literacy Council. This project is funded by the Government of Canada’s Youth Employment and Skills Strategy. The ENYCD program will have 4 cohorts, each having a 6-week session. These sessions will contain 4 weeks of formal and non-formal classroom learning where students will earn credentials such as first aid, food safe, or WHMIS, as well as workplace skills and ‘soft skills’ such as communication, teamwork, and leadership. Additionally, each session will contain 2 weeks of work placement with local partner employers where they will be able to put these new practices to use.
