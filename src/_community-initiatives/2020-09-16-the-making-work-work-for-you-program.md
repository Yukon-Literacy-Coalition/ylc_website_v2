        The Making Work, Work for You program (I yéi jinéiyi, i jeyées yéi
        jinganéi) is a 12- week hands-on learning program that started in
        Carcross in July 2020. It is designed to help participants plan, develop
        and operate a small business. The program is also designed to foster an
        entrepreneurial spirit and encourage and support personal wellness
        through physical, mental, spiritual and emotional health.


        With a high concentration on hands-on learning, the participants of the program have already experienced running multiple pop-up businesses at the Whitehorse Outdoor Fireweed Community Market in Shipyards Park. This has been a great opportunity to practice the skills needed to run a small business from start to finish. The participants have experimented with a traditional bannock recipe and created new flavours weekly to sell at the market. They sell the fresh bannock with hand-picked fireweed flower jelly, and sweetened earl grey tea with fireweed simple syrup.
