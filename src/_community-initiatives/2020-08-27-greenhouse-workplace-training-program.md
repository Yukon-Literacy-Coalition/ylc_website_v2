One of our program initiatives is a Greenhouse Workplace Training program. The 21-week program started in April of 2019 in the Village of Haines Junction, Yukon. It was designed to combine wellness, non-formal learning (soft skills) and formal learning (hard skills), with the operation of two commercial greenhouses.
