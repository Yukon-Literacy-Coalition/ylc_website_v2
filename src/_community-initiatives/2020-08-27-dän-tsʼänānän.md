      body: The Yukon Literacy Coalition, Champagne Aishihik First Nations (CAFN), and
        Yukon College are working together on a 40-month project called Dän
        Tsʼänānän, which is a federally funded program designed to increase
        capacities and employment for CAFN citizens. The vision of the program
        is to deliver innovative and culturally appropriate programming that
        focuses on peoples' strengths and brings about positive change for
        at-risk citizens. The intention is to increase literacy and employment
        skills of CAFN youth and adults that are out of school, under-employed,
        or unemployed.

      body: The Dän Dákeyi Uyenjì (That person knows our country) program is a 21-week
        skill development course to train CAFN citizens in interpretive guiding
        on traditional CAFN territory. The course, designed by Yukon University
        in consultation with leading experts in the commercial guiding field,
        provides wellness, non-formal learning (soft skills) and formal learning
        (hard skills) and seeks to bring in traditional knowledge and skills
        together with current best practices of the guiding industry. Trainees
        in Whitehorse during the winter of 2019 learned new skills and honed
        existing skills such as group management, interpretive guiding,
        avalanche safety, traditional tool making, cross country skiing, fat
        biking, ice-climbing, wilderness first aid, back-country safety,
        helicopter awareness and camp cooking.

        The 21-week program started in April of 2019 in the Village of Haines
        Junction, Yukon. It was designed to combine wellness, non-formal
        learning (soft skills) and formal learning (hard skills), with the
        operation of two commercial greenhouses.
