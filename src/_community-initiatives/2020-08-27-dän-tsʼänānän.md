The Yukon Literacy Coalition, Champagne Aishihik First Nations (CAFN), and Yukon College are working together on a 40-month project called Dän Tsʼänānän, which is a federally funded program designed to increase capacities and employment for CAFN citizens. The vision of the program is to deliver innovative and culturally appropriate programming that focuses on peoples' strengths and brings about positive change for at-risk citizens. The intention is to increase literacy and employment skills of CAFN youth and adults that are out of school, under-employed, or unemployed.
