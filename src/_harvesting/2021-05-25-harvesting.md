      body: All plants have different requirements for harvesting. Some vegetables
        will mature early enough to be harvested throughout the summer (ongoing
        harvest) while some will need to wait until August or early September to
        be big enough to harvest.

          **Leafy Greens** 


          Leaf lettuces are ready to be harvested as soon as leaves begin to appear and they are about 4 inches long. Simply snip either single outer leaves or grab a bunch of them and cut them with shears or scissors an inch above the crown of the plant. If you cut into or below the crown, the plant will probably die, so be careful. Harvest before any seed stalks start growing in the middle of the plant otherwise the lettuce will be too bitter to eat. Some greens, like lettuce, will become bitter as the season progresses. Others, like kale, will get sweeter as the temperature cools.

          **Onions**


          In late summer, the leaves on the onion plants will start to flop over. This happens at the neck of the onion and it signals that the plant has stopped growing and is ready for storage. If the weather is dry and there's no danger of frost, the plants can be gently pulled from the soil and laid right in the garden for a day or two. If the weather is wet or frost is possible, move the onions immediately into a protected spot. Spread the onions out in a single layer in a warm, dry and breezy envirnoment. As the onions are curing, their necks will gradually wither and the papery skins will tighten around the bulbs. Once the necks are completely tight and dry, and the stems contain no moisture, you can use scissors to trim the roots off the bottom of each bulb.
