      body: All plants have different requirements for harvesting. Some vegetables
        will mature early enough to be harvested throughout the summer (ongoing
        harvest) while some will need to wait until August or early September to
        be big enough to harvest.

          **Leafy Greens** 


          Leaf lettuces are ready to be harvested as soon as leaves begin to appear and they are about 4 inches long. Simply snip either single outer leaves or grab a bunch of them and cut them with shears or scissors an inch above the crown of the plant. If you cut into or below the crown, the plant will probably die, so be careful. Harvest before any seed stalks start growing in the middle of the plant otherwise the lettuce will be too bitter to eat. Some greens, like lettuce, will become bitter as the season progresses. Others, like kale, will get sweeter as the temperature cools.

          **Onions**


          In late summer, the leaves on the onion plants will start to flop over. This happens at the neck of the onion and it's sign that the plant has stopped growing and is ready for storage. If the weather is dry and there's no danger of frost, the plants can be gently pulled from the soil and laid right in the garden for a day or two. If the weather is wet or frost is possible, move the onions immediately into a protected spot. As the onions are curing, their necks will gradually wither and the papery skins will tighten around the bulbs. Once the necks are completely tight and dry, and the stems contain no moisture, you can use scissors to trim the roots off the bottom of each bulb.

          **Peas**


          When harvesting for pea pods, you can harvest when the pods are flat but at the right length for your variety of peas. It is also determined by what you want from the pea. If you prefer edible pods with developed seeds, allow more time before harvesting peas.  When harvesting, pick peas with two hands. Secure the vine with one hand then pinch the stem of each pod and pull with the other hand. Don’t tug or jerk pods away; pea plants hang on to their support with thin tendrils so a heavy hand can dislodge the plant from its support.

          **Beans**


          Beans are ready to pick when the pods are still smooth, snap easily and the seeds haven’t formed bulges along the pod. Look for lean full beans that are firm to the touch.  To harvest the bean, grasp the top of the bean and notice the little stem that connects the bean to the main vine. Break off the bean at the stem. You don’t want to damage the vine or plant, so be careful you don’t pull too hard on the bean before it’s truly been broken off.

          **Beets**


          To determine whether beets are ready to be harvested, clear away some of the mulch or soil around the top of your beets and look for crowns protruding above the soil line. If you can see an inch or two sticking out above the soil, it’s a safe bet that they are ready for pulling. If your roots don’t look quite ready and a frost is in the forecast, don’t worry! Beets are a cool weather crop, and a light frost or two can actually sweeten their flavor. Just make sure to dig them up before the ground freezes. When you have decided it’s time to harvest, use a garden fork or knife to gently loosen the soil around each plant, being careful not to accidentally slice into any of the roots. Once the soil is loose, grab hold of the green tops and lift carefully, while simultaneously prying the soil underneath with a hand fork or garden knife.
