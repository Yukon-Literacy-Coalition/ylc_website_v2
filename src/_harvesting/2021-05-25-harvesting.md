      body: All plants have different requirements for harvesting. Some vegetables
        will mature early enough to be harvested throughout the summer (ongoing
        harvest) while some will need to wait until August or early September to
        be big enough to harvest.

          **Leafy Greens** **(lettuces, kale and spinach)**


          Leafy greens are ready to be picked as soon as the leaves are large enough to be worth picking. Pick before any seed stalks appear. Some greens, like lettuce, will become bitter as the season progresses. Others, like kale, will get sweeter as the temperature cools.
