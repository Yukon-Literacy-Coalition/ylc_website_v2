      body: All plants have different requirements for harvesting. Some vegetables
        will mature early enough to be harvested throughout the summer (ongoing
        harvest) while some will need to wait until August or early September to
        be big enough to harvest.

          **Leafy Greens** **(lettuces, kale and spinach)**


          Leaf lettuces are ready to be harvested as soon as leaves begin to appear and they are about 4 inches long. Simply snip either single outer leaves or grab a bunch of them and cut them with shears or scissors an inch above the crown of the plant. If you cut into or below the crown, the plant will probably die, so be careful. Harvest before any seed stalks appear. Some greens, like lettuce, will become bitter as the season progresses. Others, like kale, will get sweeter as the temperature cools.
