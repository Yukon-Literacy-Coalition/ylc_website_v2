        Yukon Health offers many resources to support you and your child.


        If you're pregnant, you and the people supporting you can attend a prenatal class in Whitehorse. The class provides information on support for families during the prenatal period; during labour; and after the new baby arrives.


        You can attend free baby talk sessions that provide an opportunity to chat with a nurse regarding any current concerns or questions and meet other parents with new babies. Baby talk is a weekly group meeting for new parents. There's a different topic each week. Some of the topics include immunizations, growth and development, introducing solid foods, breastfeeding, safety, and key health issues.
