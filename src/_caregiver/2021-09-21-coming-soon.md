        The Child Development Centre offers a variety of programs and provide a
        wide range of services; from answering questions about behaviour, sleep
        and feeding, to providing physiotherapy or speech language therapy, to
        working with families whose child has just recieved a diagnosis. 


        Your child does not need to have a diagnosis. If you have questions about your child's development, they are a great resource to access. For more information about the Child Development Centre, check out their website below.
