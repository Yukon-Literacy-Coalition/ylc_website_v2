        CPNP also know as Healthy Babies-Healthy Futures, aims to improve
        maternal-infant health, increase the rates of healthy birth weights, and
        to promote and support breastfeeding. The program also aims to promote
        the creation of partnerships within communities and strengthen community
        capacity to increase support for vulnerable pregnant women and new
        mothers.


        Pregnant or new mothers can participate in this program, and be a part of this special community, until their child turns 1 year old. Weekly gatherings with other new moms, meals, guest speakers and many other offereings take place on an on-going basis. Space is limited and all women are asked to register.
