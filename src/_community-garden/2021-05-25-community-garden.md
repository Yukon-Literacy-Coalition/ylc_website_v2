        In the summer of 2021, the Yukon Literacy Coalition developed a Learning
        Garden adjacent to the Pioneer Hotel in Shipyards Park in Whitehorse. It
        was built with guidance from Master Gardeners Agnes Seitz, Gertie
        Scharrer, Randy Lewis and Marc Boulerice. 


        The garden has an abundance of plants including flowers, vegetables, fruit trees, berries and heritage plants grown in the north. Some of the plants were donated by local gardeners Joan Oram, Diana Mulloy, Miriam Kazami and Shawn Verrier.


        Throughout the 2023 summer family literacy staff will be offering a variety of play-based, exploratory opportunities to learn and grow in the garden. Explore the mud kitchen and water table, paint with dirt on the outdoor easels, pick strawberries, and watch for events.
