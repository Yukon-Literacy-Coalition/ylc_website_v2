        In the summer of 2021, the Yukon Literacy Coalition developed and built
        a heritage teaching garden adjacent to the Pioneer Hotel in Shipyards
        Park in Whitehorse. The garden will provide an opportunity for people to
        learn about planting, maintaining and harvesting a garden. The vision is
        to have family literacy programming, workshops for adults, and teachings
        about traditional healing plants.


        The garden has an abundance of plants including heritage flowers, vegetables, fruit trees, berries and a bed of traditional healing plants. Some of the plants were donated by local gardeners.


        This summer the focus is on building the infrastructure of the garden with a plan to start delivering programming in the garden during the summer of 2022.
