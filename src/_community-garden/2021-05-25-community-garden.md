        In the summer of 2021, the Yukon Literacy Coalition developed a Learning
        Garden adjacent to the Pioneer Hotel in Shipyards Park in Whitehorse. It
        was built with guidance from Master Gardeners Agnes Seitz, Gertie
        Scharrer, Randy Lewis and Marc Boulerice. 


        The garden has an abundance of plants including flowers, vegetables, fruit trees, berries and a bed for traditional healing plants. Some of the plants were donated by local gardeners  Joan Oram, Diana Mulloy, Miriam Kazami and Shawn Verrier.


        Throughout the 2022 summer Bart Bounds will be offering various gardening workshops on Thursday evenings in the garden. Topics such as seed starting, watering and fertilizing, harvesting and composting.
