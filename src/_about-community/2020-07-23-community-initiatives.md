The Yukon Literacy Coalition works with multiple partners on community specific and Yukon wide programs and projects.  We embed Literacy and Essential skills in adult programs, learning foundation life skills while running greenhouses, being on the land, building small businesses, running a Photo Booth, engaging in a community cooking program and on and on; we even provide personal financial literacy training in all of the Yukon communities.
