      body: The Yukon Literacy Coalition works with multiple partners on community
        specific and Yukon wide programs and projects. We embed Literacy and
        Skills for Success in adult programs, learning foundation life skills
        while running greenhouses, being on the land, building small businesses,
        running a Photo Booth, engaging in a community cooking program and on
        and on; we even provide personal financial literacy training in all of
        the Yukon communities.
