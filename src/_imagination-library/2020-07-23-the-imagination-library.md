 The Yukon Imagination Library is a chapter of the Dolly Parton Imagination Library, which was started by the country singer herself to address low literacy rates in her home state of Tennessee. Dolly wanted to foster a love of reading among preschool children and their families. She wanted children to be excited about books and to feel the magic that books can create, regardless of their familyâ€™s income. She decided to mail a brand new, age appropriate book each month to every child under 5 so that every child could experience the joy of finding their very own book in their mailbox. All Yukon children under age 5 can register to receive free books in the mail each month through the Yukon Imagination Library and the Yukon Reads Society. Please note that the Yukon Imagination Library can only serve children residing in the Yukon. [A Link](www.google.com)
