      subTitle: Family Literacy Centre on Wheels
      body: >-
        We operate a successful and flourishing Family Literacy Centre in the
        Canada Games Centre and Shipyards Park in Whitehorse. We offer free
        daily programming for families to come and learn together through play. 


        We also, at the best of times, travel to all Yukon communities with our outreach program.


        Unfortunately, this past year has not been the best of times. Covid-19 restrictions have taken their toll on all of our lives and routines. For YLC specifically, that means we have been unable to travel to communities and deliver programming. In response, we have decided to create a Family Literacy Centre on Wheels: a retrofitted 24 passenger bus in which we can provide free family literacy programming, including crafts, games and storytelling. The bus will be stocked with a free library and resources that will help parents support their childrenâ€™s language and literacy development.


        The Family Literacy Centre on Wheels will allow us to visit and deliver programs in rural communities and gatherings including festivals, fish camps, culture camps, general assemblies and kids summer camps.


        We are asking for your support. We are hoping to raise $60,000 to purchase, retrofit, furnish and insure our new Family Literacy Centre on Wheels. We are looking to our fellow community members to help us fulfill this goal. 


        The Yukon Literacy Coalition is a registered charity and can offer tax receipts for donations.
