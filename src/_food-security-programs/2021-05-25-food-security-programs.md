      subTitle: The Heritage Teaching Garden
      body: >-
        In the summer of 2021, the Yukon Literacy Coalition developed and built
        a heritage teaching garden adjacent to the Pioneer Hotel in Shipyards
        Park in Whitehorse. The garden will provide an opportunity for people to
        learn about planting, maintaining and harvesting a garden. The vision is
        to have family literacy programming, workshops for adults, and teachings
        about traditional healing plants.


        The garden has an abundance of plants including heritage flowers, vegetables, fruit trees, berries and a bed of traditional healing plants. Some of the plants were donated by local gardeners.


        This summer the focus is on building the infrastructure of the garden with a plan to start delivering programming in the garden during the summer of 2022.

      subTitle: Little Chefs
      body: Whether at the Family Literacy Centre, or our summer location the Pioneer
        Hotel, our Little Chefs program invites children and families to
        practice basic cooking skills while exploring new foods and simple
        recipes. Each Little Chefs session begins with a story and focusses on
        families working together to create tasty meals and snacks that are both
        nutritious and fun to make. Research shows that when we cook nourishing
        foods with our children, we model healthy choices that set them up for a
        lifelong love of eating well. Plus, when preparing food, we practice a
        range of basic literacy skills like counting, measuring, identifying and
        labelling, effective communication, cooperation, and more!

      subTitle: Kids in the Kitchen
      body: >-
        In partnership with the Kwanlin Dun First Nation, our staff provide
        weekly cooking classes to K-6 students throughout the school year. As
        part of the Kenädän Kú / House of Learning tutoring program,
        participating students develop basic cooking and kitchen safety skills
        while learning to prepare simple, healthy recipes they can make
        independently at home. In addition to 1:1 instruction from our staff,
        older students are encouraged to guide the younger children through
        reading recipes, using math to measure, decision making, trying new
        foods, and cleaning up. 


        When the covid-19 pandemic left students isolating at home, this program ensured that participants were able to cook nutritious meals while out of school. Multiple kitchen-themed Literacy Activity Bags were distributed to individual households and contained the ingredients, kitchen-ware materials, and instructions to prepare various healthy meals with their families.
