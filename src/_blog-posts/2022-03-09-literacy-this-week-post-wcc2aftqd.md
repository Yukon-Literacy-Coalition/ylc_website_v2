      subTitle: Ice Fishing
      body: >-
        The Yukon has a tremendously vibrant fishing scene, with many lakes and
        water bodies to access, the winter months make some of these lakes more
        accessible. It’s a great way to take advantage of the frozen lake and
        explore the newly accessible spots that you have been longing to try.
        Many opportunities are now available all you need to do is drill a few
        holes and drop a few lines and then wait and see what bites.


        You don’t need all the fancy gear, you can head out with a bucket, an auger, and your rod. The gear does make the whole situation much more pleasurable but if you don’t have all of it you just need to choose your fishing day a little better.


        Anything is possible if you are willing to trek and trudge your way around the lake. Or if you are lucky enough to own a snowmobile or fat bike, you will find the urge to go further and explore longer. If you’re looking for a relaxing day on the lake check out the Yukon News article below for a few suggestions of gear that may be helpful on the lake for a day of fishing.
