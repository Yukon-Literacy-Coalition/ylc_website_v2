      body: >-
        [American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, natural language](<>). ASL
        is expressed by movements of the hands and face. It is the primary
        language of many North Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing, and
        is used by many hearing people as well.


        It is suggested that ASL arose more than 200 years ago from the intermixing of local sign languages and French Sign Language (LSF, or Langue des Signes Fran√ßaise).


        Fingerspelling is part of ASL and is used to spell out English words. In the fingerspelled alphabet, each letter corresponds to a distinct handshape. Fingerspelling is often used for proper names or to indicate the English word for something.
