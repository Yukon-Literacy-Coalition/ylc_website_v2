      subTitle: August is National Dog Month!
      body: >-
        Our furry friends bring so much joy into our lives every day that it
        only seems fair to give them a full month of extra love and celebration.
        So, throughout the month of August let’s celebrate dogs of all breeds,
        shapes, sizes, and colours. Dogs are the most commonly owned pet on the
        planet, estimating that over 40% of all households in Canada have a
        canine companion.


        Though this celebration originated as a month of awareness in order for the public to recognize the number of dogs that need to be rescued worldwide, either from public shelters or rescues, there are many other reasons this month should be recognized.


        The advantages of owning a dog are endless and research has shown that dogs come with some powerful health benefits. While we are all aware of the immediate joys our furry friends bring into our lives, many of us are unaware of the lifestyle benefits that occur with the help of our pets. Studies have found that pet owners are less likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, have less stress, feel more connected, and have better heart health. Not only do our doggos keep us feeling happier but they also help us keep more physically active, provide structure to our lives, and most importantly leave us feeling unconditionally loved.


        So how do we celebrate our pup? There are so many ways we can give back to our dogs in celebrating them. Take them for an extra-long walk, throw a few extra cookies their way, or buy them a new fun toy! If you want to take it the extra mile you could always make them a dog-friendly cake or donate to your local shelter.


        Let’s not forget the origin of National dog month and start thinking about adopting your very own rescue pup today!
