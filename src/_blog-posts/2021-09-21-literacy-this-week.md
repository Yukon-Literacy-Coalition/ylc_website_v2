      subTitle: Word Search Puzzles
      body: >-
        Word search puzzles originated in Spain in the 1960s and is known there
        as “Sopa de Letras” (Soup of Letters). The *objective* of a word search
        is to locate a list of words hidden on a grid. As each of the words is
        located, they are circled on the grid and then struck from the list. The
        purpose of a word search is to entertain, educate, and bring people
        together.


        Word search puzzles come in a variety of levels making them suitable for all ages and are now accessible online as well as in paper format. They are particularly beneficial to children as they can boost a child’s learning.
