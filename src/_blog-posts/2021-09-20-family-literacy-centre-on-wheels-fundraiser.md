        Our fundraiser for a Family Literacy Centre on Wheels was a big success.
        We surpassed our goal of $60,000 and raised a total of $63,710.00. 


        We could not have done it without the generosity of many local organizations and donors. 


        We would like to thank the following organizations for their invaluable contribution to our Family Literacy Centre on Wheels fundraiser: Scotiabank, CIBC, TD Bank, ATCO Electric, Northwestel, Yukon Energy, First Nations Bank of Canada, Challenger Geomatics, Walmart, Crowe Mackay, and Arctic Star. Through their generosity we were able to purchase an excellent bus and are in the beginning stages of the retrofit process. Our goal is to have our new Family Literacy Centre on Wheels on the road by the summer of 2022.


        Thanks to this support our organization will continue to meet the unique needs of rural Yukon families by bringing a range of literacy-based activities and resources to all Yukon communities.


        We invite you to check out our Facebook and Instagram pages to track our progress!
