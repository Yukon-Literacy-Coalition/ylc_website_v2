        Identifying animal tracks is a fun skill to add to your toolkit if you
        are someone who enjoys spending time outdoors. Knowing which critters
        you are sharing a space with and how close you are to them can become a
        great way to ensure a safe interaction or observation of the natural
        occupants of the landscape. Having a good understanding of the prints
        themselves and the direction they are moving can make for a more
        engaging interaction with animals in a natural setting.
