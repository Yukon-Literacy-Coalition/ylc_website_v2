      body: >-
        As spring comes to an end, we close the Family Literacy Centre in the
        Canada Games Centre and move into our summer location, the Pioneer Hotel
        in Shipyards Park. Built during the gold rush in 1889, the Pioneer Hotel
        boasts a long and storied history as a rooming house, a hotel, a bar and
        restaurant, and a private residence. Now a designated heritage building,
        the Pioneer Hotel is home to the summer Family Literacy Centre, the
        Learning Garden, and the Free Bookstore. Come join us weekdays from June
        6th to September 1st and enjoy free, drop-in, everyone welcome, children
        and family programs and activities.
