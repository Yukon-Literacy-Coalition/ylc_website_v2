        The Yukon Literacy Coalition is developing a Heritage Garden that will
        be a teaching and learning garden. It is also a loose replication of a
        garden that might have been grown by early Yukon gardeners. This year
        (2021) we are concentrating on the physical development of the garden,
        researching what was planted in historical gardens and experimenting
        with modern best gardening practices. In the spring of 2022, we hope to
        be offering “all about gardening” classes, hands-on workshops and
        resources for families. 


        We are grateful to all our experts including Agnus Seitz, Randy Lewis and Marc Boulerice.


        We look forward to sharing the garden with you soon!
