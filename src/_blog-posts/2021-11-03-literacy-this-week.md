      body: >-
        1. **Unconditional love** **and endless cuddle times!** Grandparents get
        to enjoy unconditional love and excitement from their grandchildren. Did
        you know that a hug and snuggle combined is called a huggle?


        1. **Children add a burst of energy to your life**. With their endless zest and enthusiasm for everything, you can’t help but feel positive and be reminded of the pleasures of life.


        2. **Fun, fun, fun!** Everyday life has its ‘to-do’ lists, but when the grandchildren arrive, you can put it on hold and focus on having fun, being silly and enjoying your time together.


        3. **Watch your own children become amazing loving, caring, parents!** Witnessing this is such a wonderful privilege. A time to pat yourself on the back for raising such an amazing child who followed in your footsteps.


        4. **The opportunity to share your own stories and cultural experiences** with your grandchildren.You get to tell them stories about what life was like when you were a child and read them your favourite nursery rhymes and bedtime stories.


        5. **Grandparents can provide children with a sense of family history** and respect for their elders. The joy of being a grandparent has been passed down from generation to generation. 


        6. **The relationship** between children and grandparents… it’s the best! A unique relationship that is different from a parent and child. There is nothing quite like it and grandkids will most definitely change grandparents lives for the better, forever.


        7. **Other family members or friends can also fill the role of ‘grandparent’**. While the definition of grandparent is “parents of one’s father or mother”, this role can be played by another important person in the child’s life.
