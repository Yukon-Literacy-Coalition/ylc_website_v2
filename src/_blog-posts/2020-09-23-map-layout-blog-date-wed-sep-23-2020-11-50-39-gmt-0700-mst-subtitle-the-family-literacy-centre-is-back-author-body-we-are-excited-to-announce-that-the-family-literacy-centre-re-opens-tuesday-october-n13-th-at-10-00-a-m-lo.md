        We are excited to announce that the Family Literacy Centre (FLC)
        re-opens Tuesday, October 13th at 9:30 a.m. Located upstairs at the
        Canada Games Centre in Whitehorse, the FLC offers free, drop-in programs
        for children and families to learn and play together. Join us for
        crafts, singing, activities, story time, sensory play and more! No
        registration or wristbands required.


        In order to make programming safe for our families during the pandemic, we’ve made a few changes to our space that make practicing the “Safe Six” simple. For example, free play will consist of activity stations that make it easier to social distance.


        If you have any questions or would like to know more about what we’re doing to keep safe, give us a call at 867 668 8698 or visit our facebook page, Yukon Family Literacy Centre.


        We look forward to seeing you soon!
