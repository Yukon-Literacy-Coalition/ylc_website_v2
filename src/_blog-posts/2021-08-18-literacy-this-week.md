        Are you tired of the same old salad this summer? Try some of these tips
        to jazz up your salad:


        1. Incorporate a **variety of textures**: chewy, soft, crunchy, wet, and dry.  


        2. **Add color** with berries, grated carrot, tomatoes, or edible flowers.                                      


        3. **Balance sweet and sour**. Lemon will temper an excess of salt or sugar, while sweet ingredients like maple syrup will calm too much acid.                                                                 


        4. **Pair ingredients and dressing carefully**. Delicate seafood might not work with a lot of heavy spice.                                                                                                                                      


        5. **Add heat** with mustard, garlic, or chili.                                                                                     


        6. Transform a side salad into a main course by **adding protein, carbohydrates, and fat**.  


        7. **Avoid over seasoning**. Wait until the cooked elements are prepared, the dressing made, and the veggies tossed before you add salt and pepper to taste.                                             


        8. Use **sea salt** (fine or coarse), and grind **pepper** in a mill for best flavor.                               


        9. **Think in layers:** Start with your base veggies or leaves, then add a layer of dressing, a layer of crunch (try seeds or nuts), a layer of “bite” (such as cheese, chili, or pickles), followed by another layer of veggies or leaves, and so on. This way you don’t have all the best bits at the top.
