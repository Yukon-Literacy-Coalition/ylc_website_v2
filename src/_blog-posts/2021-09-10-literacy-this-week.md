        **Jiggs’ Dinner** is arguably the most traditional Newfoundland recipe.
        Some families have Jiggs’ Dinner on special occasions, while some have
        it every Sunday! Salt meat – or salt beef (which is cured beef purchased
        in a bucket), cabbage, potato, carrot, turnip, and yellow split peas are
        all boiled together in a single pot. Some families add meat, such as a
        turkey or roast beef.


        **Toutons** are another fan favorite in Newfoundland. A touton is simply fried bread dough. Whenever someone makes homemade bread, some bread dough was always put aside to make toutons.


        Check out the recipe for Jiggs' Dinner and Toutons in the Yukon News article below.
