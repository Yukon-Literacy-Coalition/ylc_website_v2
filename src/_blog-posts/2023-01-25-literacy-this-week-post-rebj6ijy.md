      body: As our garden continues to thrive, the need to harvest has become
        demanding! This summer, our selection of leafy greens has done
        exceptionally well. This leafy green selection includes lettuce, kale,
        spinach, and arugula. It is easy to tell once these greens are ready to
        be harvested - there simply has to be enough worth harvesting!
