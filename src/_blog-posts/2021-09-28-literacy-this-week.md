      body: Do you love picking cranberries each fall? Packing a picnic lunch, bear
        spray, a thermos of tea and your berry bucket to find the perfect patch.

        favourite ways to use the fresh cranberries is to make scones. Check out
        the Yukon News article below for our staff pick scone recipe.
