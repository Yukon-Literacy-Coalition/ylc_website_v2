        In Canada, the second Monday in October is celebrated as Thanksgiving
        Day. It is a statutory holiday so one can take time to reflect, be
        thankful, and for families and friends to gather to enjoy the perfect
        Thanksgiving meal.


        The very first Thanksgiving celebration took place in Canada when a European explorer, Martin Frobisher, arrived in Newfoundland in 1578. He wanted to give thanks for his safe arrival to the New World. He pulled together an impromptu harvest feast and gave thanks not only for the delicious feast, but also for his crew's safe passage at sea. That means the first Thanksgiving in Canada was celebrated 443 years ago! Even then, food was at the forefront of the celebration.


        Today, Canadians continue to give thanks for the harvest season thus celebrated in October. A Thanksgiving meal usually features a turkey, although ham or other roasts may be substituted. This centerpiece is complemented by an array of favorites: gravy, stuffing, harvest vegetables, and desserts.


        So, take a moment this Thanksgiving to reflect and be thankful. Enjoy your family gathering, pumpkin pieand a whole lot of turkey!


        Happy Thanksgiving!
