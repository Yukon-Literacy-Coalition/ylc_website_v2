        Exciting news! Today, we started renovating the bus. We are so excited
        to be moving forward with this project and are looking forward to having
        our new Family Literacy Centre on Wheels on the road in 2022. We would
        like to thank to Mark Steudle for removing all the seats and taking a
        lead on the design stage of this project.
