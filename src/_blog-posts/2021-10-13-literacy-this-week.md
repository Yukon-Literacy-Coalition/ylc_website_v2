        As we head further into fall many Yukoners will be heading into the
        wilderness in search of a plentiful harvest. If you are one of them,
        think about taking the art of the “moose call” along on the adventure.
        It is one of the more popular and successful ways of locating and
        conversing with this oversized ungulate and can add an extra dimension
        to your already exciting endeavor. Moose calls can encompass many noises
        from low guttural grunts to long sultry moans or a mix of both.
