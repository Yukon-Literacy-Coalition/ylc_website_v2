        The Yukon Literacy Coalition is very sad to announce that our space at
        the Canada Games Centre (the Family Literacy Centre) will no longer be
        available to us as of November 10th, 2023. After more than a decade of
        providing a safe space for all Yukon families to gather, learn and play,
        YLC has been informed that the City of Whitehorse requires the space for
        staff offices.


        We understand that change is inevitable. As a vital and growing community, the City of Whitehorse requires infrastructure, and we are grateful for their many years of support. This decision, however, leaves us without a Family Literacy Centre, and so now we are actively looking for a new home.


        On November 4th, we will celebrate the Family Literacy Centre and the people who contributed so much over the years. We will release more details about this celebration as the time approaches.


        We are unable to offer our regular fall programming at the CGC but will continue offering our programs at the Pioneer Hotel in Shipyards Park and throughout the Yukon. We are confident that our community will assist us in finding an alternate location, and we are eager to resume these essential services from a new space as soon as possible.
