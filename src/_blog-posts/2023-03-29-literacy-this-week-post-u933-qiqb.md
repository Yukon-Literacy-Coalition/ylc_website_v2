        We all have our favourite pastimes. Quiet nights with a good book, games
        of shinny on the local rink, picking tunes with pals, and video games
        until the wee hours.


        There is one extra-curricular activity, however, that everyone can agree is truly in a league of its own. An activity that is so thrilling, so gripping, that it really is more of a lifestyle than a mere hobby. The pastime in question is, of course, cribbage.
