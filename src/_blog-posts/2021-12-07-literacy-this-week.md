        Do you have extra kids’ books lying around?


        The Yukon Literacy Coalition is running a children's book drive to assist in our events and programs. 


        Bring your gently used children's books to the Family Literacy Center upstairs in the Canada Games Centre, or to the Yukon Literacy Coalition office or drop box in the Horwoods mall.


        Donations will be dispersed throughout the Yukon and at our annual Family Literacy Day celebration.


        Thank you in advance for your generosity!
