        In response to Covid-19 not allowing us to travel to Yukon communities
        as much as we typically would, we have decided to create a Family
        Literacy Centre on Wheels: a retrofitted 24 passenger bus in which we
        can provide free family literacy programming, including crafts, games
        and storytelling. The bus will be stocked with a free library and
        resources that will help parents support their childrenâ€™s language and
        literacy development.


        The Family Literacy Centre on Wheels will allow us to travel and deliver programs in rural communities and at gatherings including festivals, fish camps, culture camps, general assemblies and kids summer camps.


        The Yukon Literacy Coalition is a registered charity and can offer tax receipts for donations. Every dollar helps us get closer to our goal! If you'd like to donate to the Family Literacy Centre on Wheels, please click the 'Donate Now' button. Thank you!
