        through our most recent fundraising initiative, an online auction. The
        money raised will be used towards the purchase of a bus that will be
        retrofitted to become a Family Literacy Centre on Wheels. We would like
        to thank everyone who participated in the online auction as well as a
        big thank you to the following organizations for donating items to the
        auction:"
