        If you are in Shipyards Park this summer, you will see a lot of new
        activity. The City of Whitehorse is building a giant playground for
        children and the Yukon Literacy Coalition is building a Heritage Garden
        that will be used as a teaching and learning garden for all Yukoners. To
        keep within the theme of the Pioneer Hotel, the garden is loosely
        designed like a garden that might have been grown by early Yukon
        gardeners. It includes plants such as delphiniums, shasta daisies,
        rhubarb and lilacs.


        This year, we are concentrating on the physical development of the garden, researching what was planted in historical gardens and experimenting with modern best gardening practices. In the spring of 2022, we will be offering “all about gardening” classes, hands-on workshops and resources for the whole family.


        If you have any questions, please speak with one of our staff working at the Pioneer Hotel in Shipyards Park or call our office at 867-668-6535.


        We look forward to sharing the garden with you soon and if you have extra perennials, we will be happy to plant them in our garden!
