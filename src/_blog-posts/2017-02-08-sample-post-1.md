        Welcome to the New and Improved Yukon Literacy Coalition website. We are
        so pleased to launch our beautiful new website. Thank you to Aaron Janke
        for his design and building work and to Lisa and Victoria for their
        dedication and hard work on the project. We appreciate any feedback. The
        Yukon Literacy Coalition, like everyone else, has been impacted by
        COVID19. We are adapting our programming to make them safe for everyone.


        We will be providing program updates on this site and on our Facebook page-Yukon Family Literacy Centre, or for more information call us at 668-6535.
