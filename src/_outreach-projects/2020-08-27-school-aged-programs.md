title: School-Aged Programs

The YLC partners with the Kwanlin Dün First Nation in their Kenädän Ku (House of Learning) afterschool tutoring program. This program encourages the development of essential skills and positive reading behaviours without mirroring a school environment. It's designed for kids who benefit from additional support in fluid reading practice, vocabulary study, reading comprehension, and learning confidence. Currently, YLC staff engage students in Kids in the Kitchen cooking lessons, where they learn independent cooking skills, kitchen safety, and the power of cooperation.
