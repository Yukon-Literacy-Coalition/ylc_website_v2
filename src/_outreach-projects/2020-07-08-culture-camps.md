The Yukon Literacy Coalition is honoured to be able to participate in culture camps and cultural celebrations by First Nation communities around the Yukon. YLC staff come equipped with fun and relevant literacy and essential skills activities for people of all ages to enjoy. It's free and is a fun way to encourage a life-long love of learning. In the past, we’ve attended Kluane First Nation Harvest Camp, The Moosehide Gathering, Kluane Muskrat Camp, Has Ḵusteeyí Celebration and Ta'an Fish Camp.
