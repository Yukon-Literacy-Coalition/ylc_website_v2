  a bachelor's degree in Human Kinetics from the University of British Columbia
  and a Bachelor of Education through the Yukon Native Teacher Education
  Program. Anya is an experienced educator with a passion for land-based
  education. She strives to promote fun and positive educational experiences to

  acceptance, connection and belonging. In her free time, Anya can be found
  riding her mountain bike, skiing, canoeing or hiking. There is nothing Anya
  loves more than being in nature.
