role: Family Literacy Manager
bio: Stephanie is a Family Literacy Specialist with an educational background in
  Early Learning, and Fine Art/Photography. Originally from Ontario, her 35
  years of work experience in both daycare settings and schools has brought her
  to all corners of Canada's north - from Dawson City, Yukon, to James Bay,
  Ontario, and from Pangnirtung, Nunavut, to Atlin, British Columbia and more
  than a decade in Whitehorse. Married to Chris, mother of three grown boys, and
  having most recently added ‘Nana’ to her title, Stephanie also has a wealth of
  life experience to draw from. She loves to integrate her extensive knowledge
  of the north, along with her passion for children's literature, art and
  creativity, into learning programs with families at the Family Literacy Centre
  and beyond.
