role: "Family Literacy/Community Outreach Coordinator "
bio: Lia is a Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialist who loves helping
  others to live a vibrant and healthy life through leisure, learning, and
  community. She graduated with a Bachelor's of Human Kinetics with a focus in
  Community Health Promotion in 2013. This has led to her work with various
  populations such as adults with mental health disorders, youth in rural BC,
  and older adults in long term care. Originally from Vancouver Island, Lia is
  at home wherever she is close to nature (and her husband and pets). Some of
  her favourite things in life are wildflowers, birds, yoga, bulletproof coffee
  and lifelong learning (which is why she chose to work for the YLC)!
