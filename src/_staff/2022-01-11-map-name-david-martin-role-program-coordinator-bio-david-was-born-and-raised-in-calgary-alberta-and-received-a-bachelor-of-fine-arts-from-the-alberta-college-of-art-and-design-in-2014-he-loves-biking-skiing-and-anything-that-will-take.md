bio: David was born and raised in Calgary, Alberta and received a Bachelor of
  Fine Arts from the Alberta College of Art and Design in 2014. He loves biking,
  skiing and anything that will take him outside. His passion for art and the
  outdoors brought him to the Yukon in 2016 where he worked as a ski technician
  and as a hot glass instructor. The skills gained from these positions will
  continue to expand as he learns and grows at the YLC.
