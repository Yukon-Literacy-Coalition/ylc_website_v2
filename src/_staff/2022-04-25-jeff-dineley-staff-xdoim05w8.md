bio: Jeff’s a classic Ontario transplant who hasn’t looked back since first
  coming to the North in 2010. He has worked in education for most of his
  career, having taken on various roles both in and out of the classroom. He is
  happy to be living in the Yukon and working with such a dynamic team to serve
  our amazing communities. When he’s not out there working to promote literacy
  and support community development, you may find Jeff out enjoying nature or
  picking tunes with friends.
