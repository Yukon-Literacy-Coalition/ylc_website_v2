role: Summer Student
bio: Erin was born and raised in Whitehorse Yukon, where she developed her love
  for the outdoors â€“ hiking, skiing, running, and mountain biking. She moved to
  Kelowna to attend the University of British Columbia Okanagan in 2016 where
  she continues to work towards attaining her Honours in Psychology. Though Erin
  has spent the last 4 winters in Kelowna, she always returns back home to
  Whitehorse to enjoy the beautiful Yukon summers that she loves so much. Her
  first job teaching swimming lessons was where she first realized the
  importance of bringing a fun approach to learning. She has continued to bring
  this concept to her job at the Family Literacy Centre.
