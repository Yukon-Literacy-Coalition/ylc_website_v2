        The Yukon Literacy Coalition is offering a pre-employment training
        program called ‘Pathways to Success’ to help strengthen the Yukon
        tourism/hospitality workforce.


        The first session of this training program will take place on the traditional territory of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations at Long Ago Peoples Place. Facilitation and training will be led by elders and First Nations citizens who are experts in language, culture, history, and traditional land skills. Safety courses and customer service skills will also be included in the 4-week training program, which includes 2 weeks of work placement.


        This training opportunity is open to all Yukon First Nation citizens. Please forward this to anyone in your community who may want to participate. Interested people can contact Margot Neely ([margot.neely@yukonliteracy.com](mailto:margot.neely@yukonliteracy.com)) or Jeff Dineley ([jeff.dineley@yukonliteracy.com](mailto:jeff.dineley@yukonliteracy.com)) to get an application form.
