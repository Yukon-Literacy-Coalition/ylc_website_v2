        The Family Literacy Centre (FLC) is a large family-friendly room filled with books, crafts, puppets, toys, puzzles, chalkboard, music, dress-up and more. We offer mini programs most mornings and drop-in play time during the afternoon. The FLC offers free, daily, drop-in programs that help parents build both their parenting and life skills, while providing young children with early childhood education opportunities. Our qualified staff specialize in early childhood education and promote early learning and literacy skills. We help connect families to the community resources they need and support families to become lifelong learners. 


        The FLC is located on the second floor of the Canada Games Centre and is open from September through May. Come visit us to sing, play, do crafts, enjoy both structured and unstructured programs and have fun! All programs are free, drop-in and everyone is welcome. To participate in our programs, you do not have to pay the Canada Games Center fee. Just walk up the stairs to the FLC and join us! 


        For regular updates on our free programming, please check out our Facebook page.

        Every year as the spring season comes to an end, we close the Family
        Literacy Centre in the Canada Games Centre and open our summer location
        The Pioneer Hotel in Shipyards Park. Come visit from June to August and
        enjoy your favourite free, drop-in programs and activities; no
        registration required. Sing and dance by the Yukon River; explore the
        park with binoculars and magnifying glasses; jump on the trampoline,
        grab a snack, or have a hot drink; browse our large selection of free
        books; and blow some bubbles with your friends. 


        All programs are covid-safe and in accordance with territorial guidelines.
