        The Family Literacy Centre (FLC) is a large family-friendly room filled with books, crafts, puppets, toys, puzzles, chalkboard, music, dress-up and more. We offer mini programs most mornings and drop-in play time during the afternoon. The FLC offers free, daily, drop-in programs that help parents build both their parenting and life skills, while providing young children with early childhood education opportunities. Our qualified staff specialize in early childhood education and promote early learning and literacy skills. We help connect families to the community resources they need and support families to become lifelong learners. 


        The FLC is located on the second floor of the Canada Games Centre and is open from September through May. Come visit us to sing, play, do crafts, enjoy both structured and unstructured programs and have fun! All programs are free, drop-in and everyone is welcome. To participate in our programs, you do not have to pay the Canada Games Center fee. Just walk up the stairs to the FLC and join us! 


        During summer months, you can visit us at the **Pioneer Hotel** for some of your favourite Family Literacy Centre programs! We're located across from the gazebo in Shipyards Park. Check out this video about the Pioneer Hotel by MCY youth [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qg68c5roKQ&fbclid=IwAR0-41J98G_dxB-L0YUQngbri69NvXIUfy1FSmXlzvfOD6-fwmk9Q_24QgQ).
