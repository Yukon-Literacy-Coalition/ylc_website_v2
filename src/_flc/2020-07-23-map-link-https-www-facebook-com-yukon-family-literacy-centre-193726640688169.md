        When we play together, we learn together! 


        The Family Literacy Centre (FLC) is a large family-friendly space filled with books, crafts, toys, puzzles, music, and more. Open six days per week, the FLC offers free, everyone-welcome, daily drop-in programs for families to learn together through play. With structured activities most mornings, and unstructured drop-in play time every afternoon, our programs help families build essential life skills while providing early learning opportunities for their children. Our qualified staff specialize in early childhood education and family literacy. We connect families to the community resources they need, and help them become lifelong learners.  




        The FLC is located on the second floor of the Canada Games Centre and is open from September through May. Come visit us and have fun! All programs are free, drop-in and everyone welcome. No registration or wristband required. 


        For regular updates on our free programming, please check out our Facebook page.

        Every year as the spring season comes to an end, we close the Family
        Literacy Centre in the Canada Games Centre and open our summer location
        The Pioneer Hotel in Shipyards Park. Come visit this summer from late
        May - mid September (dates pending) and enjoy your favourite free,
        drop-in programs and activities in the Learning Garden! Sing and dance
        by the Yukon River; pick a fresh strawberry; learn about growing; play
        in the mud kitchen; explore with magnifying glasses; browse our large
        selection of free books; and much more!


        All programs are covid-safe and in accordance with territorial guidelines.
