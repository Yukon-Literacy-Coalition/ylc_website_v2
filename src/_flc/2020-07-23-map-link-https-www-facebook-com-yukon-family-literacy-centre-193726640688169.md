        The Family Literacy Centre (FLC) is a large family-friendly room filled
        with books, crafts, puppets, toys, puzzles, chalkboard, music, dress-up
        and more. We offer mini programs most mornings and drop-in play time
        during the afternoon. The FLC offers free, daily, drop-in programs that
        help parents build both their parenting and life skills, while providing
        young children with early childhood education opportunities. Our
        qualified staff specialize in early childhood education and promote
        early learning and literacy skills. We help connect families to the
        community resources they need and support families to become lifelong
        learners. 


         The FLC is located on the second floor of the Canada Games Centre and is open from September through May. Come visit us to sing, play, do crafts, enjoy both structured and unstructured programs and have fun! All programs are free, drop-in and everyone is welcome. To participate in our programs, you do not have to pay the Canada Games Centre fee. Just walk up the stairs to the FLC and join us!

        Every year as the spring season comes to an end, we close the Family
        Literacy Centre in the Canada Games Centre and open our summer location
        The Pioneer Hotel in Shipyards Park. Come visit from June to August and
        enjoy your favourite free, drop-in programs and activities; no
        registration required. Sing and dance by the Yukon River; explore the
        park with binoculars and magnifying glasses; jump on the trampoline,
        grab a snack, or have a hot drink; browse our large selection of free
        books; and blow some bubbles with your friends. 


        All programs are covid-safe and in accordance with territorial guidelines.
